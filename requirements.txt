# Core Dependencies for Phase 1: From Scratch

# AI Model API
google-generativeai==0.3.2

# Environment variable management
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Web UI framework
streamlit==1.29.0

# Note: These are the ONLY dependencies needed!
# 
# Why so few?
# - We're building from scratch (not using agent frameworks)
# - google-generativeai: To call Gemini API
# - python-dotenv: To manage API keys securely
# - streamlit: To build beautiful UI
#
# Total install size: ~50MB
# 
# Compare to framework-based approach:
# - LangChain + dependencies: 200+ MB
# - CrewAI + dependencies: 150+ MB
#
# Building from scratch = lighter, faster, clearer!
